coordination/discussion repo for the oakland nodeschool. no code, just the issue tracker.

this group isn't fully public like the ones listed on nodeschool.org, we are instead keeping it invite only while we are starting out. if you wanna learn more we recommend coming to some http://oaklandjs.com/ meetups to meet others in the oakland JS community
